Synthapse
=========

This is a hacky little toy synthesiser I wrote when I wanted to make my major
work for my high school leaving certificate in music sound like a cheap
synthesiser from the 1960s. I'm yet to clean it up.

Written in python 2. Works great with pypy, and you'll probably be needing it.

The sample sequence in synth.py is one half of the melody of that ridiculous
composition of mine. There were two parts, this one was square-waveish and
lower, the other was sawtooth-waveish and higher.
